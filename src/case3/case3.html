<h2>Case 3: Reducing groceries</h2>

<p>
    The input data is a list of groceries you just bought from Albert Heijn. Use the <code>reduce</code>
    method in case3.controller.js to do calculations on the prices.

    The discount (where applicable) is in euros per unit and has already been deducted from
    the item's price.
</p>

<hr>

<h3>Total price ($scope.totalPrice)</h3>
<p>
    Calculate the total price by multiplying the price per unit with the amount bought.
</p>

<section class="solution" check-solution="totalPrice" name="totalPrice">
    Total price: € {{totalPrice}}
</section>

<hr>

<h3>Total discount ($scope.totalDiscount)</h3>
<p>
    Find all the items that have a <code>discount</code> property and use that to calculate
    the total amount you saved while shopping. You also have a coupon for € 2.50 discount so
    add that to the calculation as well!
</p>

<section class="solution" check-solution="totalDiscount" name="totalDiscount">
    Total discount: € {{totalDiscount | number:2}}
</section>


<hr>

<h3>Every item counts ($scope.allItems)</h3>
<p>
    The cashier doesn't care about maths, she just scans item one by one.
    Turn the grocery list into an array of item names, repeating items you bought more than
    one of. (Items with a unit of <code>"kg"</code> only count as one item). Example:
</p>

<pre>[ "AH Tijger wit", "AH Tijger wit", "Appels Jonagold", "Chiquita bananen", ... ]</pre>

<p>
    Note: the resulting array has more items than the original data, so <code>map</code> won't work.
    Use <code>reduce</code> to create the new list.
</p>

<ul class="solution" check-solution="allItems" name="allItems">
    <li ng-repeat="item in allItems track by $index">{{item}}</li>
</ul>
